Build defenses with curve projector.

# How to:
1. Research the curve projector
2. Place it
3. Connect a green wires to the connectors on either side of the projector, they are looking for X, Y, U, V signals. X,Y signify the position of the control point, U, V signify the control vector at that point.
4. Connect a green wire to the connector in the middle of the projector, send it signal D to **D**raw the curve, send sit signal B to **B**uild the wall, and signal T to set the **T**hickness.
5. Gaze at your beutiful curvy walls.


This is an early release of the mod, I'm only releasing it now to see if there would be any interest for something like this.

There other features planned for the future, but right now it has only one. Feel free to share your thoughts and crashlogs on the modpage.
